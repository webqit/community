The tooling, cloud, and community for web native development - [WebQit.io](https://webqit.io)

> *Bank more on the web platform and less on abstractions!*

## What We're Working On

Web native tooling around the concept of `state`, `reactivity`, `data binding`, `routing`, `rendering`, the `component` model, the `SPA/MPA/MPA+SPA` architecture, and more.

### [JavaScript Graph Functions](https://github.com/webqit/subscript)

[Proposal/polyfill] The basic, one-liner answer to fine-grained reactivity. (Introducing Imperative Reactive Programming (IRP) in JavaScript.)

### [The Observer API](https://github.com/webqit/observer)

[Proposal/polyfill] The JavaScript object observability API. (Think the return of `Object.observe()`, but one for every occasion!)

### [OOHTML](https://github.com/webqit/oohtml)

[Proposal/polyfill] The DOM API suite that enables a more modular and reusable HTML. ((Re)Introducing HTML Imports and more.)

### [Webflo](https://github.com/webqit/webflo)

[Framework] The universal framework for building *no-JS/low-JS* web sites and apps. (One epic piece that puts all of the above together.)

## About the WebQit Project

WebQit is a focused initiative to ezplore new ways to leverage the web platform! We're drawing on learnings from the past decade to develop the tooling, cloud, and xommhnity for web native development.

We're big on web standards and believe the best use of our time is to build new technologies that extend the standards, rather than obscure them. Our projects are therefore often of proposals and polyfills for new DOM and browser APIs that push the limits to what's possible natively.

## Why Web Native Tooling

Frameworks encode a lot of good thinking, but come at a price!

The web platform gives us much for free, but leaves much to be desired!

Web native tooling is how all of that good thinking could find their way to the web platform! This helps everyone bank more on the platform and less on abstractions!

Perhaps, this is the best way to move the web forward!

## Getting Involved

It's easy, and especially kind on our day of little beginnings! We welcome any form of contribution - PR, issue, discussion, etc - on any of these projects.
