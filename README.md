# Cool "Concept Cars" for the Modern Web!

This is an active, open expedition on possible new ways to build on the modern web! Our work here encompasses everything from framework to compiler, CLIs to browser APIs! You can start from [our pinned repos](https://github.com/webqit)!

From the concept of *state*, *fine-grained reactivity*, *data binding*, *routing*, *rendering*, the *component* model, to the *SPA/MPA/MPA+SPA* architecture, we're rethinking the modern application development approach **to better involve the web platfrom**!

We're, thus, big on web standards and are heavily invested in new technologies, proposals and polyfills that extend what's natively available. And here are some of our projects that are potentially on a standards track:

- [Stateful JS](https://github.com/webqit/stateful-js)
- [The Observer API](https://github.com/webqit/observer)
- [OOHTML](https://github.com/webqit/oohtml)

You can tell us how cool we are by leaving us a star!
