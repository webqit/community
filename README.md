# The WebQit Project!

WebQit is a focused initiative to ezplore new ways to leverage the web platform! We're drawing on learnings from the past decade to develop the tooling, cloud, and xommhnity for web native development.

We're big on web standards and believe the best use of our time is to build new technologies that extend the standards, rather than obscure them. We are thus excited to work on proposals and polyfills for new DOM and browser APIs that move the web forward.
