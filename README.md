Explore a new ecosystem of technologies that open up new ways to go web-native on the modern application story!

From the concept of *state*, *fine-grained reactivity*, *data binding*, *routing*, *rendering*, the *component* model, to the *SPA/MPA/MPA+SPA* architecture, we're rethinking the modern application development approach to better involve the web platfrom!

## Our Work on Two Tracks:

**Platform-Level Tooling (Proposals and Polyfills):**

- **[JavaScript Contract Functions](https://github.com/webqit/subscript)**: An upcoming proposal that lets us have fine-grained reactivity in the imperative form of the language. (Introducing Imperative Reactive Programming (IRP) in JavaScript!)
- **[The Observer API](https://github.com/webqit/observer)**: An upcoming proposal for an object observability API in JavaScript. (Think the return of the `Object.observe()` API, but one for every occasion!)
- **[OOHTML](https://github.com/webqit/oohtml)**: An upcoming proposal for a DOM API suite that enables a more modular and reusable HTML. ((Re)Introducing HTML Imports and more.)

**Application-Level Tooling (Libraries and Frameworks):**

- **[Webflo](https://github.com/webqit/webflo)**: The universal framework for building *no-JS/low-JS* web sites and apps. (One epic piece that puts all of the above together.)
- *[and more](https://github.com/webqit)*.

## Getting Involved

We welcome any form of contribution - PR, issue, documentation, etc - on any of our projects. And it's easy!
